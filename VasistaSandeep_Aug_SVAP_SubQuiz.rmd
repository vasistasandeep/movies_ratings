## Frame
- 5 graphs for movie rating xlsx
- Correlation between audience and critic ratings evolved throughout year by genre
## Acquire Data
Getting data from Movies-ratings.xslx
```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/vasistas/Documents/From_Mydownloads/PGP-BDA/In_class/2nd_Residency/SVAP_Amit/Assignment/Subjective_quiz")
movie_ratings=read.csv("Movie-Ratings.csv",header=TRUE)
movie_ratings
```

```{r}
ggplot(movie_ratings, aes(x=Genre, y=0)) + geom_jitter() + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-2,2))
# The above plot is known as stripchart which is a univariate plot
# We can see Sction, comedy and Drama are dense while Romance and Adventure have less dense distribution of films
```
```{r}
ggplot(movie_ratings, aes(x = Genre, y = Budget)) + geom_point()
# if we observe the dataset movie_ratings we will get to know 
# that the variable Genre is categorical in nature 
# So we will need to tell ggplot2 that Genre is a categorical variable.
# We can see Highest budget movie is action and Horror combines for least budget.
```
```{r}
ggplot(movie_ratings, aes(x = Year, y = Rot, color = Aud)) + geom_point()
# The above plot shows relationship between critic rating and Audience rating with Year realesed of the movie_ratings 
# with varying critic rating of the movie rating Audience rating shown in different colors.
```
```{r}
ggplot(movie_ratings, aes(x = Genre, y = Rot, size = Aud)) + geom_point()
#This plot also same as above, but this Audience ratings of 
#Movies is shown with varying sizes for Fenre type
```

```{r}
ggplot(movie_ratings, aes(x = Budget, y = Rot)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()
# Smoothing means to use algorithms to remove noise from a data set, 
# allowing some important patterns to stand out. 
# To add smoothing lines we would the geom geom_smooth() by default 
# it uses LOESS smoothing which stands for Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing
```
```{r}
ggplot(movie_ratings, aes(x = Rot, y = Aud)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
# If we want to change the previous plot to use 
# ordinary linear model smoothing we can use the method = "lm" argument.
# The shaded portion in the above plots shows the 95% Confidence Intervals 
# which also known as the standard error, we can remove this shaded portion 
# using the argument se = FALSE
```
```{r}
ggplot(movie_ratings, aes(x = Rot, y = Aud, col = factor(Year))) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
# Sometimes in our data we might like to see patterns in the 
# data based on some subgroups or categorical variables which 
# can be shown using the aesthetic col
# In the above ggplot command our smooth is calculated for each 
# subgroup because there is an invisible aesthetic group which inherits from col. 
```
```{r}
ggplot(movie_ratings, aes(x = Rot, y = Aud, col = factor(Year), fill = factor(Genre))) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 5, alpha = .5)
# The above plot is used whenever we need to distinguish the 
# data points based on four categorical variables - Audience rating, Rotten tomatoes, Genre and Year
